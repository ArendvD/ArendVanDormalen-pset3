Problem Set 3 for course Native App Studio at the University of Amsterdam

This app allows a search request on movie database "omdb".
Items in results can be clicked, making more information pop up in a new screen.

Some functions are still to be implemented, namely a "watch list" with saved favorites, and loading the movie posters.
The movie posters are also available on the database. The links have already been implemented in the data objects.
